/**
 * PhpGetBrowser formatter class
 *
 * This formatter modifies the basic data, so that you get the same result
 * as with the PHP get_browser() function (an object, and all keys lower case).
 *
 * @note There is one difference: The wrong encoded character used in
 * "browser_name_regex" of the standard PHP get_browser() result has been
 * replaced. The regular expression itself is the same.
 * @see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=612364
